**** README FOR STUDENT ROSTER ***

Final version completed November 2 2020. 

The program maintains a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program include student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program.

A string was created for each student matching the requirements for the project that are split into classes to be displayed in the console once run. The classes show different reports to give information about the students attending this school.
